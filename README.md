#### General:
- The backend team should, one at a time, start connecting the finished backend pages with the frontend team. During this, the frontend team should be testing the connection with a set of basic user cases.
- Moving in and out of pages, uploading correct and wrong information, etc.

## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions :construction: :bulb:

- Having everyone’s machine work with React Native.
  - If this is an issue then we can switch to Flutter and see if that works, otherwise confer with others to find a better solution that works for everyone.
- Fetching all the available restaurants nearby
  - If the online APIs or databases don’t contain the correct restaurants nearby then we would have to create our own database containing those values.
  - Or list the restaurants in Dallas rather than a specific location
- Implement the chatbot with the user’s dietary and restaurant information.
  - A solution to this would be to either create a small chatbot that answers basic questions or replace this feature with a stretch goal
- Either the Frontend or Backend team falling behind.
  - If this happens the best course would be to get some assistance from the other side until caught up

<br>

## Competition :vs:

- Yelp, Zomato, Tripadvisor (no personalization or AI assistant)
- Individual restaurant apps/sites (limited scope)
- Subpar diet filter sites (poor recommendations)
- General search engines (not food-specific)

<br>

## Git Commands :notebook:

| Command                       | What it does                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| git branch                    | lists all the branches              |
| git branch "branch name"      | makes a new branch                  |
| git checkout "branch name"    | switches to speicified branch       |
| git checkout -b "branch name" | combines the previous 2 commands    |
| git add .                     | finds all changed files             |
| git commit -m "Testing123"    | commit with a message               |
| git push origin "branch"      | push to branch                      |
| git pull origin "branch"      | pull updates from a specific branch |
